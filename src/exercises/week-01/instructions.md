# Week-01 - Introduction to React

Welcome to **Week 01** of the React curriculum! 🎉  
This week we’ll get familiar with the basics of React and make sure your local environment is working.

## Exercise: "About Me" Component

In this exercise, you’ll create a simple **About Me** page using JSX and React components.

## Before Starting

Make sure your Vite development server is running!

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project folder.
2. In your terminal start your app by running the dev script:
3. You should see something like:
   - `VITE v7.1.1  ready in 290 ms ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/`
4. Woohoo! 🎉 You’ve successfully spun up your Vite app. Open the local URL in your browser to confirm it’s working.

## Steps

1. **Open the file:**  
   `src/exercises/week-01/studentWork.jsx`
2. **Inside of the component** create:
   - A variable for your name
   - A variable for your age
   - A list of your hobbies using an array
3. **Return JSX** includes:
   - A heading about you
   - A short paragraph introducing yourself
   - Map out your hobbies or interests so they all appear on the page in a list.

## Proof of completion

Once your About Me page displays correctly in the browser:

1. Take a screenshot of your rendered page (showing your profile information).
2. Save that image in the same directory where you’re working on your component: src/exercises/week-01/
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Submit your pull request (PR) link for review.

### Reminder

- ReactDOM (already set up for you) renders your app inside <div id="root"></div> in index.html.

Great Job getting through Week 01!
if your page runs without errors, treat yourself to a snack. You’ve earned it. 🍪
